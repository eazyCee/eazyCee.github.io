		<p>for 6 months in 2021, I enrolled in Bangkit 2021, a program initiated by Google in collaboration with 

Gojek, Traveloka, and Tokopedia that aims to develop tech talents in Indonesia through creating projects and 

online classes. Out of almost 28,000 registrants, 3000 were selected to enroll and thankfully I was one of 

them. It was a rigorous process of continued learning and implementation, and at the end of the program we were 

tasked to create a capstone project that encompasses everything we've learned during the project, which will be 

peer reviewed and judged. My team and I decided to create a tourism app called 'Torem' that aims to recover 

Indonesia's falling tourism sector caused by the pandemic.</p>
